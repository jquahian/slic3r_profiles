notes = tests of Slic3r for Raise3D \n\ntest#4 \nFeb27.2017\n\ntest#3 \nDec 21.2016\n\nTEST 1 ran twice - loss of extrusion at level of thinner walls - maybe due to too fast speed at interior infill (zigzags?) or lots of threading due to too small retraction distance? (1.5) \nslowed down all speeds - remember to increase if print is successful. \nincreased retraction to 3mm \n\ntest 2 - ran once - result looked good but was brittle - poor interlayer adhesion. maybe due to extruder temp? Raised to 270 and retry. Also trying 0 infill, all perimeters.
